What we did:
Created a Digital Twin prototype of a cookie factory using an AWS tutorial

Why we did it:
wanted to see how to create a digital twin of the lab, created the prototype to see what requirements there are, if its worth it, and how we would interact with it

What tech we used:
-AWS

What we learned:
AWS digitaltwinmaker is relatively easy to set up and offers predictive services, i.e. showing how much power our printer is using each day and how it affects the other pieces of the lab.
