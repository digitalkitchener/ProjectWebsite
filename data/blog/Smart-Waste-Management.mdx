What we did:
Researched various company products that are capable of monitoring waste levels in park bins

Why we did it:
CoK is looking for smart waste pilot projects to implement into the area to have bins refilled more efficiently

What tech we used:
-Powerpoint

What we learned:
There are a lot of smart waste options out there, sensors and stand alone bins etc. Certain products will work better for what we are trying to accomplish.
