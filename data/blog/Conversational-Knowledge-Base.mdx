What we did:
- Created a simple file-based question-answering app
- Allows user to ask questions in natural language

Why we did it:
To allow quick and effective access to hard to find information across multiple documents

What tech we used:
- OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model
(text-davinci-003)
- Next.js
- Vercel(for future deployment)

What we learned:
- GPT-3 provides fairly accurate results when asking questions
- Able to provide reference and context to the answer from the provided documents
- Prompt Engineering could be done to detect intent of question
(eg. self harm)
