summary: DKIL was tasked with coming up with an alternative to virtual tours, something that could familiarize new community centre employees without them requiring to come in person, or have someone give them an online tour
---

What we did:
- Created 3D scans of environment using LiDAR sensor on iPhone
- Uploaded generated 3D model on Spatial.io for navigation and interactivity

Why we did it:
To provide new community centre employees with an immersive orientation experience

What tech we used:
- LiDAR scanning using PolyCam on iPhone
- Blender for post-processing
- Spatial.io for hosting 3D environment and interactive elements
- VR headset can be used to visit space

What we learned:
- iPhone is able to generate 3D models with decent geometric and visual accuracy
- Spatial could be used to visualize future development projects with an existing architectural model
