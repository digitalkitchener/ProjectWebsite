# Digital Kitchener Innovation Lab

The Digital Kitchener Innovation Lab lives in the Communitech Hub and brings new thinking to civic challenges. Kitchener is one of the first cities in Canada to open a lab dedicated to exploring how digital technologies can improve the lives of residents.

Our team explores how emerging technologies can improve city services like:

- Climate and air quality monitoring
- Multimodal traffic counting
- Asset tracking

We experiment with new ways to deliver great service and empower the city with data-informed decision making. This allows Kitchener to constantly evolve and prepare for the city of the future.
